## Ruby Katas

Katas can be a great way to improve our understanding of syntax.
For these problems please try to solve them by passing one test at a time.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Ruby 2.7+
  - You can get any version of ruby using `[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)`

### Instructions

1. Fork this repo to your own account
2. Complete the workflow steps outlined below to make ONE test pass
3. Make a pull request and assign to someone in @RailsQuest/reviewers to review (most likely @pingortle ðŸ˜„)
4. Repeat steps 2-4 until fully green test suite
5. Congrats! You made it! ðŸ˜Ž

#### Workflow example
- `cd word-count`
- Open empty code file in your editor: `$EDITOR word_count.rb`
- Run tests: `ruby word_count_test.rb`
- Make the failing test pass
- Commit
- Delete `skip` line from the next test
- Repeat until complete
